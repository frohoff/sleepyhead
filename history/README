This folder contains the python/GTK script I (jedimark) wrote that eventually turned into SleepyHead

I can't honestly tell you if this is the latest version, because the computer I originally wrote this on died.

I put it here for project history, reference (and humour at how sad it is.) 

It requires matplotlib and pygtk to run.. Probably pytz too, I honestly can't remember if it needed any other libs.

I've mostly forgotten python since then.
