SleepyHead QT port v0.9 branch

SleepyHead is cross platform, opensource sleep tracking program for reviewing CPAP and Oximetry data, 
which are devices used in the treatment of Sleep Disorders like Obstructive Sleep Apnea.

Requirements:
-------------
Qt5 SDK with webkit (opengl stuff recommended)
Linux needs libudev-dev for qserialport to compile


Building:
--------

Recommend shadow building to not cruft up the source code folder:

cd ..
mkdir build_sleepyhead
cd build_sleepyhead
qmake ../sleepyhead-code/SleepyHeadQT.pro 
make

You may need to add a -spec option to qmake to suit your platform. 
Adding -j3 speeds up the make command on a dual core or greater system.
