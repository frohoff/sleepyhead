<h1><image src="qrc:/docs/sheep.png" width=64 height=64>SleepyHead v0.9.7 <b>Testing</b></h1>

<p><h2><b>Release Notes</b></h2></p>
<p>Greetings!</p>
<p>Here is a new and hopefully improved SleepyHead build.</p>

<p>0.9.7 already? Yup.. otherwise I can't tell them apart, and you probably won't be able to either. Before anyone asks, yes, version numbers will go past 0.9.10 before 1.0.0 is reached.</p>
<p>Not a gigantic set of changes this time, but I've been busily working my way through a lot of bugs mentioned on the forums, trying to knock them down one by one. Please don't be offended if yours isn't in here yet.. I have a memory like a goldfish, plus I tried to focus on stability issues first.</p>
<p>A gentle reminder for anyone submitting bug reports (either via message or through sourceforges bug reporting system), please (please please) remember to state the SleepyHead version number, your computers platform and operating system type version (and service packs), and your CPAP machines type and model number. Without this information I pretty much don't have a clue what you are talking about.</p>
